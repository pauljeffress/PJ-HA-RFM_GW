# PJ-HA-RFM_GW
My HA RFM_GW code.
Up until 17-10-2017 I hadn't used GitHub to manage my RFM_GW code. Now that I am about to convert it to run on a SAMD21 (SenseBender board) I thought I'd get it onto GitHub so I can manage the required changes.
The last version I had before bringing it to GitHub was PJ_RFM_MQTT_GW_22v27. I had just recently made a few changes from v26 when I updated my Node code to support a SAMD21 (Adafruit Feather M0 RFM69) and the gateway code had to be slightly modified to accomodate that new Node code.  Prior to that the RFM_GW v26 code had been unchanged for maybe 6mths.
